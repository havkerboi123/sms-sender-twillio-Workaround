# sms-sender-twillio-Workaround

I was assigned with the task to manually send texts to students for a recruitment drive but being a lazy head i wrote a python + apple script that usees iMessages on my mac to send the SMS. The python script reads the excel file for names , timeslots and venues. This is passed on to the apple script.
